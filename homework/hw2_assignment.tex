\noindent {\bf Problem 1: (25 points)}

Consider the generic discrete-time system discussed in class:

\begin{figure}[!h]
	\centering
	\resizebox{0.9\textwidth}{!}{\input{../lectures/figs/ctd-lti-dtc.tex}}
	\caption{Diagram for discrete-time processing of continuous-time signals.}
\end{figure}

Let's assume that input signal $x_c(t)$ and the discrete-time LTI system $h[n]$ have the following frequency-domain representation:

\begin{figure}[h]
	\begin{subfigure}[t]{0.5\textwidth}
		\centering
		\resizebox{\textwidth}{!}{\input{figs/hw02_input_spectrum.tex}}
		\caption{~}
	\end{subfigure}%
	\begin{subfigure}[t]{0.5\textwidth}
		\centering
		\resizebox{\textwidth}{!}{\input{figs/hw02_dt_lti.tex}}
		\caption{~}
	\end{subfigure}
	\caption{(a) Fourier transform of the input signal $x_c(t)$ and (b) frequency response of the discrete-time system.}
\end{figure}

We'll consider two different scenarios. In the first, sampling is performed at the Nyquist rate. That is, $\Omega_s = 200\pi$. In the second scenario, we'll assume that the signal is under-sampled with $\Omega_s = 160\pi$.

\begin{description}
	\item{(a)} For each scenario, sketch the Fourier transform of the discrete-time signal $x[n]$.
	\item{(b)} For each scenario, sketch the Fourier transform of the output signal after the discrete-time LTI system.
	\item{(c)} Suppose that for reconstruction, we use the ideal lowpass filter with cutoff frequency $\Omega_s/2$. For each case, sketch the Fourier transform of the output continuous-time signal $y_r(t)$.
\end{description}

\noindent {\bf Problem 2: (25 points)}  (from mid-term exam, fall 2009)

A continuous-time random signal $x_c(t)$ has autocorrelation function
$\phi_{x_c x_c}(\tau)$ and corresponding power spectrum $\Phi_{x_cx_c}(j\Omega)$, which is shown in Figure \ref{fig:CTspectrum}.
\begin{figure}[h]
	\centering
	\input{figs/hw02_spectrum_linear_taper.tex}
	\caption{PSD of the continuous-time random signal.\label{fig:CTspectrum}}
\end{figure}

This signal is sampled with sampling period $T$ to yield the discrete-time
random signal $x[n]=x_c(nT)$.
\begin{description}
\item{(a)} Determine the sampling period $T$ so that the power spectrum of
    the discrete-time sampled sequence is a constant, i.e., of the form\[
    \Phi_{xx}(e^{j\omega}) = \sigma_x^2\quad |\omega|\leq \pi.
    \]
    In other words, choose $T$ so that the resulting sampled signal is a
discrete-time white noise signal.

\item{(b)} Determine the value of the average power $\sigma_x^2$.
\item{(c)}  Is the result of part (a) only possible because of the linear
    taper of the continuous-time power spectrum?  If not, can you think of
    a general condition such that a non-white continuous-time spectrum will
    become a white spectrum after sampling? \\
\emph{Hint:} Consider what conditions the autocorrelation function would have to meet.%
\end{description}

\noindent {\bf Problem 3: (20 points)}

Consider the continuous-time representation of the process of sampling
followed by reconstruction shown in Figure \ref{fig:sampreconst}.
\begin{figure}[h]
\centering
\input{figs/hw02_impulse_train_reconstruction.tex}
\caption{Representation of sampling and reconstruction.\label{fig:sampreconst}}
\end{figure}

Assume that the input signal is
\[
x_c(t)= 15 + 10\cos(600\pi t)+ 5\cos(1500\pi t - \pi/3) \quad
-\infty < t < \infty
\]
The frequency response of the reconstruction filter is
\[
H_r(j\Omega) = \left\{\begin{array}{ll}
    T& \quad |\Omega|\leq \pi/T \\
    0& \quad |\Omega| > \pi/T
    \end{array} \right.
\]

\begin{description}
\item{(a)} Determine the continuous-time Fourier transform
$X_c(j\Omega)$ and plot it as a function of $\Omega$.
    \item{(b)} Assume that $f_s=1/T=2000$ samples/sec and plot the Fourier
        transform $X_s(j\Omega)$  as a function of $\Omega$ for $-2\pi/T
        \leq \Omega \leq 2\pi/T$.  What is the output $x_r(t)$ in this
        case? (You should be able to give an exact equation for $x_r(t)$.
    \item{(c)}
    Is it possible to choose the sampling rate so that
    \[
    x_r(t)=A + B\cos(\Omega_{0} t )
    \]
    where $A$ is a constant?  If so, what is the required sampling rate
    $f_s=1/T$, and what are the numerical values of $A$, $B$, and $\Omega_{0}$?
\end{description}

\noindent {\bf Problem 4: (30 points)}

Consider the two-channel microphone array depicted in Figure \ref{fig:array_fig}.
\begin{figure}[!htb]
	\centering
    \includegraphics[width=.75\columnwidth]{figs/array_fig}
    \caption{Two-channel microphone array. \label{fig:array_fig}}
    \end{figure}
The lowpass filtered microphone array signals are modeled by the following equations:
\begin{subequations}
\begin{eqnarray}
x_{c1}(t)&=&\alpha_1 s_c(t)+v_{c1}(t) \label{eq:1a} \\
x_{c2}(t)&=&\alpha_2 s_c(t+t_d)+v_{c2}(t), \label{eq:1b}
\end{eqnarray}
\end{subequations}
where $s_{c}(t)$ is the source component of the output of the lowpass filter of channel 1. (All signals and noises are real signals). The time-delay difference, $t_{d}$, between the two transmission paths depends on the source location, the velocity of sound (denoted $c$), and the microphone spacing, $d$. Because of the lowpass anti-aliasing filters (LPF blocks), the source signal $s_c(t)$ and the noise signals $v_{c1}(t)$ and $v_{c2}(t)$ are assumed to be bandlimited random signals whose power spectra have highest radian continuous-time frequency $\Omega_N$. We also assume that all signals are stationary with zero mean. The two filtered microphone output signals are sampled with sampling rate $2\pi/T\geq 2\Omega_N$ to give the discrete-time signals
\begin{subequations}
\begin{eqnarray}
x_{1}[n]&=&\alpha_1 s[n]+v_1[n] \label{eq:2a} \\
x_{2}[n]&=&\alpha_2 s_D[n]+v_{2}[n], \label{eq:2b}
\end{eqnarray}
\end{subequations}
where $s[n]=s_c(nT)$ and $s_D[n]=s_{c}(nT+t_d)$.  When $D=t_d/T$  is an integer, we may write $s_D[n]=s[n+D]$.
\begin{description}
\item{(a)}  Depending on the source location, $t_{d}$ may be either positive or negative. What is the range of time difference values $t_d$ that we can have if the sound source is somewhere (even just slightly) to the left of the dashed line through the microphones?
\item{(b)} Assuming that $D$ is an integer, determine an expression for the cross-correlation function $\phi_{x_1x_2}[m]=\E\{x_1[n+m]x_2[n]\}$. You may assume that the signal and noises are statistically independent.
\item{(c)} Determine the cross-power spectrum $\Phi_{x_1x_2}(e^{j\omega})$, which is the DTFT of $\phi_{x_1x_2}[m]$.
\item{(d)}  Where will the maximum value of $\phi_{x_1x_2}[m]$ occur?  How could this result be used in an algorithm for estimating the time delay $t_d$?
\item{(e)}  Assume that the sampled signal component $s[n]$ is a white random signal with  power spectrum $\Phi_{ss}(e^{j\omega}) = \sigma_s^2$ for all $\omega$. Using the result of (c) obtain an expression for the cross-power spectrum, $\Phi_{x_1x_2}(e^{j\omega})$, and use it to determine an expression for $\phi_{x_1x_2}[m]$ that is valid even when $D=t_d/T$ is \emph{not} an integer. Specialize your result for the case when $D$ is an integer, i.e., when $t_d$ is an integer multiple of the sampling period $T$.
